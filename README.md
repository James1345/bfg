BFG is a set of Java classes designed to simplify and spped up the 
creation of 2D desktop games using the Java programming language. It is
built up of a number of layers designed to handle common tasks that are
almost always implemented in the same or a similar manner, while still
allowing maximum customization.

BFG is **not** designed to teach beginners how to program or how to use
Java. It assumes you are already familiar with Java, and is here to help
you avoid the more repetative tasks.

While the source code is available, BFG can be used easly with no
knowledge of how the internals are put together, in the same way as any
other .jar file.
